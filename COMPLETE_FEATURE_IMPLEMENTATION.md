## 🚧 Remaining Views to Create

Due to the large number of views needed, I'll create simplified but functional views that cover all functionality. The views will be:

1. Contact views (Index, Manage, Add, Edit)
2. Visitor Pass views (Request, MyPasses, Manage)
3. Vehicle Registration views (Register, MyVehicles, Manage)
4. Complaint views (Submit, MyComplaints, Details, Manage, AdminDetails)
5. Poll views (Index, Details, Create, Manage, Results)
6. Gate Access Log views (Index, Statistics)

All views will follow the same pattern as Document views - clean, functional, and integrated with the dashboard.

## Next Steps

1. Create all remaining views
2. Update Homeowner Dashboard menu
3. Test all features

Let's continue creating the views!
