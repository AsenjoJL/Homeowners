# Logo Upload Instructions

## 📍 Where to Place Your Logo

Place your `logo.png` file in the `wwwroot` folder at the root of your project:

```
HOMEOWNER/
├── wwwroot/
│   └── logo.png  ← Place your logo here
├── Controllers/
├── Views/
└── ...
```

## 🔧 Steps to Upload Logo

1. **Create wwwroot folder** (if it doesn't exist):
   - In your project root: `C:\Users\John Lester\Desktop\HOMEOWNER\`
   - Create a folder named `wwwroot`

2. **Place logo.png**:
   - Copy your `logo.png` file into the `wwwroot` folder
   - Path should be: `C:\Users\John Lester\Desktop\HOMEOWNER\wwwroot\logo.png`

3. **Verify the file**:
   - Make sure the file is named exactly `logo.png` (case-sensitive)

## 📝 Current Logo References

The application currently uses `image1.png` in these locations:
- Admin Dashboard sidebar
- Staff Dashboard
- Home page navigation
- Login page
- Forgot Password page

## 🔄 Option 1: Replace image1.png

If you want to keep using `image1.png`:
- Simply rename your `logo.png` to `image1.png`
- Place it in `wwwroot` folder
- All existing references will work automatically

## 🔄 Option 2: Update to logo.png

If you want to use `logo.png` instead:
- Place `logo.png` in `wwwroot` folder
- I can update all references from `image1.png` to `logo.png`

## ✅ After Upload

Once you've placed the logo file, let me know and I can:
1. Verify the file is accessible
2. Update any references if needed
3. Test that it displays correctly
